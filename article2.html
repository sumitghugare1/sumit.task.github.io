        <h3>Article 2: "AMD vs Intel: Which CPUs Are Better in 2023?"</h3>
        <img src="amd.jpg" alt="Blog Post Image2">
        <p>
            When evaluating the latest CPU offerings, Intel and AMD present their unique takes on power and performance.
            Previously its top-of-the-line CPU, Intel’s Core i9-13900K commands attention with its 24 cores and 32 threads, and its high boost clock of 5.8 GHz is impressive.
            It maintains a TDP of 125W but can push to 253W for peak performance.
            However, Intel’s Raptor Lake refresh that was released in October saw the i9 14900K, built upon the Raptor Lake architecture, reach speeds of up to 6 GHz.
            On the other hand, AMD’s Ryzen 9 7950X3D stakes its claim with a 144MB cache and an efficient energy profile, topping at 162W under full load.
            It can also almost match Intel’s capabilities, with a boosted clock speed of 5.7 GHz, without draining that much power.
            Intel’s strengths lie in its architectural design, which delivers a balanced performance that’s tough to beat.
            The Core i9-13900K stands out for its ability to handle intensive multi-threaded tasks without breaking a sweat, making it ideal for both gaming and productivity.
            The downside? These chips can be power-hungry under load, which might lead to higher energy bills and the need for better desktop cooling solutions.
            Annoyingly, it seems that the refreshed 14th Gen chips are no exception, and although deliver better performance, haven’t been blessed with lower power consumption.
